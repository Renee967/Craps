# Craps

(Game: craps) Craps is a popular dice game played in casinos. Write a program to play a variation of the game, as follows:
 
Roll two dice. Each dice has six faces representing values 1,2, â€¦, and 6, respectively. Check the sum of the two dice. If the sum is 2,3 or 12(called craps), you lose; if the sum is 7 or 11 (called natural), you win; if the sum is another value (i.e. 4,5,6,8,9,10), a point is established. Continue until you roll either 7(you lose) or the same point value (you win). 
 
Your program acts as a single player. Here are some sample runs.
 
Example1: you rolled 5+6=11  
You win
Example2:  you rolled 1+2=3  
You lose
Example3:  you rolled 4+4=8  
Point is 8
You rolled 6+2=8
You win
Example4:  you rolled 3+2=5  
Point is 5
You rolled 2+5=7
You lose
 
Make sure that you use functions to implement subtasks and call these functions in your main function.  
(Hint: function rand() will return you a random number)
